Working with Code Challenges
============================

There are 3 phases to the code Challenges

The first phase is to set up your environment. This involves forking the base repository
from the owner and then cloning it to your local machine.
    
Once this is done, you have a few basic steps for each code Challenges such as branching
creating a personal folder and core copying files

The second phase is the coding. This is mostly just writing code in your favourite
editor, but there are key things you should be doing like commiting your code back to
your repository in case anything should happen.

The last phase, and for some the scariest, is the Pull Request. To get to the pull
request, you have you first push your code back to your repository, and then merge your
code back into the base, and then you can lodge your pull request.

The last and unspoken part is waiting for the owner to merge your Pull Request
