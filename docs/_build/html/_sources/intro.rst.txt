Welcome to the PyBites CodeChalleng.es Platform
===============================================

Our goal with our coding platform is to get you coding. A lot!

We have grown a vibrant community of Pythonistas eager to learn every nook and cranny of the Python language and ecosystem.

However, just reading a book or watching a video tutorial is not going to cut it. You need real world, hands-on practice.

Enter PyBites CodeChallenges! We have almost 200 exercises on our platform that you can code in the comfort of your browser. All of these *Bites of Py*, as we call them, come with automated tests to verify your code submissions.

You can share your code on the forums, learning alongside other developers, earning Ninja belts and certificates as you go.
